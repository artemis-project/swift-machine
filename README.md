# The Swift Machine
![Header](Resources/Repository/GitHub_Header.jpg)

The **Swift Machine** brings AliceKit apps and extensions to life and creates them from rich ideas. This integrated development environment eases the process of making beautiful and functional apps in Swift and put the developer in control, not the other way around.

Yes, we did learn from the mistakes of [Joey Drews's ink machine](https://youtu.be/Y5Cw4iPafoU?t=42s); that's why the Swift Machine is built with AliceKit itself.

## About The Swift Machine
* Current version: 0.1.0
* State: Pre-release
* Requirements:
    * Qlift 0.0.37
    * AliceKit 0.1

## Building
The Swift Machine is a certified AliceKit app and follows the general instructions for setting up and running AliceKit apps.

To build from the source code, run ```sudo swift build```. You can find the executable under ```.build/debug/swift-machine``` to use for a desktop launcher or to run from a terminal.

> Note: For anyone getting started with AliceKit, The Swift Machine aims to be the 'ideal' AliceKit app with proper structures, style guides, and documentation.
