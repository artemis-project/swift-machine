# The Swift Machine
![Header](Resources/Repository/GitHub_Header.jpg)

The **Swift Machine** brings AliceKit apps and extensions to life and creates them from rich ideas. This integrated development environment eases the process of making beautiful and functional apps in Swift and put the developer in control, not the other way around.

Yes, we did learn from the mistakes of [Joey Drews's ink machine](https://youtu.be/Y5Cw4iPafoU?t=42s); that's why the Swift Machine is built with AliceKit itself.
